## General Information
- In this project, we will try to understand how the data given by the company is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.
- Loan.csv file given by the company contains only the cases in which borrower's loan application was accepted/approved and loan is either 'Fully Paid' or 'Charged Off'. 
- We will use most popular tools available for performing 'Exploratory Data Analysis' (EDA)
- Once EDA is done, cleansed and valiated data can be used further for downstream processing such as for data analytics or machine learning.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- When 'Interest Rate' is high (and thus 'Installment Amount'), chances of defaulting the loan are high
- Maximum loans which were issued in year 2011 were defaulted
- Borrowers who have home ownership of 'Rent' or 'Mortgage' have high chances are loan default
- Not much relation between loan amount and employment duration of the borrower
- For high loan amounts, interest rates are high
